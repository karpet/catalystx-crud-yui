        * fix crud.js bug to allow for sort column to include table prefix (e.g., t2.name)

        * fix autocomplete_field to initialize the hidden input with the original internal_value
        * livegrid_create_form() controller method and supporting JS. This enables o2m and m2m creation

          or not. See the LIVEGRID_FORM_SIZE setting in crud/tt_config.tt.
        * replace all 'datatable' instances with 'livegrid' in Serializer class.
        * PK value in Serializer comes from controller to allow app override of schema class.

0.011   02 Dec 2008
        * revert crud.js to ignore m2m_url on livegrid row click. The feature needs more thought.
        * fix bug with limit != count so increased livegrid buffer size from 50 to 200.
        * disable m2m features for Excel, etc., till they can be thought through for usability.

0.012   12 Dec 2008
        * split related_field_info BLOCK into its own related_field_link.tt file. Then use it in
          autocomplete_field.tt
        * tweeks to results livegrid size
        * textarea fields use <pre>+autowrap+htmlescape unless they have HTML markup in them.
        * click on related_field_link always defaults to 'view' regardless of can_write.
          may be overridden with c.session.prefs.default_crud_action
        * add html_escape feature to Serializer
        * support dot notation for field_methods that chain related objects together.
        * skip ManyToOne and OneToOne rels in filter_relationships.tt since we assume those

        * fix undef warnings in html escape.
        * remove old crud/yui_related_datatable_js.tt

        * add Config::General to reqs
        * LiveGrid title comes from object_class (or object_class->moniker if defined) 
          rather than controller class name. 

0.015   27 Jan 2009
        * fix IE-related bugs in JS (extra commas, IE idiosyncrasies)

0.016   11 March 2009
        * add c.config.cxcy.search_uri config option for rendering search box
        * slight optimization in filter_relationships.tt for clarity

        * add YAHOO.crud.wysiwygify() to crud.js for optional Rich Text Editor on textarea fields.

0.017   16 April 2009
        * fix bug with missing 'Export as Excel' link when in View mode
        * change to extjs grey style css
        * add support for sort_prefix() in RHxFR::Metadata. This allows for setting explicit
          sort prefix strings on column names and (in theory) allows for sorting on JOINed tables
          as with m2m and o2m and FK "virtual" columns.
        * fix bug when related FK is undef in Serializer
        * enable Create and Reassign links without having to go to edit mode     
        * fix Excel view and list.xls.tt to work (finally!) with LiveGrid+Serializer
        * hide parent record action buttons when viewing related records in Edit mode (reduce
          confusion particularly for Delete button)
        * fix Export as Excel link to not escape & since it is in script tag

0.018   1 May 2009
        * move logic for can_write() check into edit.tt so that related values can be edited.
          This logic change is first supported in CatalystX::CRUD 0.40.
        * fix authz check for m2m relationships to look at the m2m controller (map_class_controller)
          rather than the foreign class controller.
        * reduce clicks when viewing related records in edit mode by making the row click take you
          to the edit url rather than the view url.
        * bump RHxFR dep version in Makefile.PL (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=45631)

0.019   17 May 2009
        * fix number of skipped tests in 01-rdbo.t
        * switch from Class::C3 to MRO::Compat and update deps in Makefile.PL
        * change Livegrid->new to accept 'c' arg instead of getting it from form->app.
          This fixes bug affecting tests under perl 5.10.

0.020   1 Dec 2009
        * add missing dep on Template::Plugin::Autoformat to Makefile
        * fix dbic test to make sort order explicit with table prefix
        * allow for cxc-* params to be set in livegrid.js and default there.

0.021   03 Feb 2010
        * add missing META.yml
        * change base URLs for ExtJS and Livegrid to point at non-MSI URLs and remove
          warning about "get your own"

0.022   17 Feb 2010
        * no changes but version bump to accomodate CPAN. Apparently I was too aggressive in 
          cleaning up old files and deleted 0.021...

0.023   20 Feb 2010
        * support for Field->description. Patch from Adam Mackler.

0.024   18 Mar 2010
        * check for field.description.length, since localization object will return true.

0.025   23 Oct 2010
        * change field.description.length to .defined to appease TT.
        * add Create Related links. Patch from Adam Mackler.
        * fix some XHTML compliance bugs (reported by Adam Mackler).
        * change 'use Class::C3' to 'use MRO::Compat' in test libs.
