* individual uri for each cell in datatable. clicking on the FK takes
  you to the foreign table, or map table.

* add full-text search with Search::QueryParser::SQL

* mangle sort strings to support re-sort of m2m tables
  by arbitrary chained methods.
  example:

    user.group.name

  should sort on t4.name
  in a left join like this:
              events AS t1
    LEFT JOIN user_events AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.event_id
    LEFT JOIN users       AS t3 ON t2.user_id = t3.id
    LEFT JOIN groups      AS t4 ON t3.gid     = t4.gid

  or even a simpler case:

    user.username

  when called from a m2m livegrid tab for an Event object
  with m2m rel 'users'. Has a m2m-mapping table called user_events.

              events AS t1
    LEFT JOIN user_events AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.event_id
    LEFT JOIN users       AS t3 ON t2.user_id = t3.id

  so user.username => t3.username
